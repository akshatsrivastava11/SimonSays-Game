SimonSays Game--HTML CSS & JavaScipt
This GitHub repository showcases a fun and interactive Simon Says game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game mimics the classic memory challenge where players must follow an increasing sequence of flashing colors and corresponding sounds.

Key Features:

Simple Gameplay: Players must correctly follow and repeat the computer-generated sequence of colors. Each round, a new color is added, increasing the complexity as the game progresses.

Sound and Visual Feedback: Each color is paired with a unique sound to enhance the user experience, providing both visual and audio cues.

Responsive Layout: Designed to be responsive, the game works smoothly across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Scorekeeping: The game tracks and displays the player’s current progress, showing the number of correct steps they’ve completed. Players can challenge themselves to beat their previous scores.


Technology Stack:

HTML: Used to structure the game interface, including buttons and the display panel.

CSS: Handles the design elements, including button colors, animations, and layout adjustments for different screen sizes.

JavaScript: Powers the game’s functionality, controlling game logic, user interactions, sequence generation, and validation of player inputs.
